<h1>Color Theory </h1>
<blockquote>Why do two colors, put one next to the other, sing? Can one really explain this? no. Just as one can never learn how to paint. </blockquote>
<p>Pablo Picaso</p>
<p>This Markdown descibes the basics of color theory, relationships, and how it is used to portray mood in art and film.</p>
    

<h2>Color Relationships</h2>

<h3>Primary Colors</h3>
<p>Red, Yellow, and Blue make up the primary colors. These are colors that can not be mixed and tend to command the most attention (Think of most road signs and logos.)</p>

<h3>Secondary Colors</h3>
<p>These are colors that are comprised of two primary colors. They are orange, green, and purple. </p>
<h3>Complimentary Colors</h3>
<p>Colors that are oposite to eachother on the color wheel. The complments are:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Red and Green</li>
    <li>Yellow and Purple</li>
    <li>Blue and Orange</li>
</ol>

<p>Using opposing colors helps define <a href = "https://thevirtualinstructor.com/contrast-in-art.html">contrast</a> in a piece. </p>
<h3>Warm and Cool colors</h3>
<p>The rainbow can be split into warm and cool colors. Red, orange, yellow, and pink would all be considered warm colors. They tend to sigmify warmth, positity, and **intensity**. The cool colors are blue, indigo, green and purple. They tend to be more mellow and signify calmness and/or sadness. Black and white are not colors in this kind of sense, but various shaded (including greys) can have warm or cool undertones, depending on the color it is mixed with. </p>

<p>All colors can have a 'Warm' and 'Cool' version, depending on the shade (For exaple, a more purpley-red is a cool red, and a orangey-red is a warm red)</p>

<h2>Real aplications of color theory</h2>
<h3>Mixing Colors</h3>
<p>Color relationships are *extremely* important when mixing colors when painting. It is vital to know that Complimentary colors, when mixed, produce a brown or grey (a neutral color). This also applys to shades. Blue and red make purple, but when a warm red (that is closer to orange) is mixed with a blue, it will produce a very grey purple tone. This is why it is important to know if a paint has multiple pigments as it may accidentally lead to neutralising a color.  
</p>
<h3>Mood and Examples</h3>
<p>
Mood is one of the most important uses of color in general. There is a reason why poisonus animals and stop signs are red, to indicate danger. Specifically, mood is used to set the tone of an art piece. There is a reason that Van Gogh's 'The Night Cafe' seems so lively and happy, while Edward Hopper's "Nighthawk', though depicting a similar scene of a restraunt at night, seems eerie and threatening:

<br>
Though it is not the only contributing artistic principal that lead to these moods, it is certainly the most prominent. The first features bright yellows and blue, a calm blue with a happy yellow. The second one uses darker greens and reds (complimentary colors)that make the scene feel uncanny and sinister.  
</p>
<h2>Further Development</h2> 
<p>If given more time, I would like to possibly go into tints, shades, and saturation and how they effect color and mood. Color relationships (such as tertiary or analogus colors), and how they affect how we percive color (such as how sometimes greys can be seen as reds) is also another important aspect of color theory that should be covered.
I would also like to add more examples, specifically of scene(s) from shows or movies that use color to potray a specific mood. </p>
